        <div class="div2">
            <h3><u>Instructions:</u></h3>
            <p>Mix all ingredients for seasonings in a bowl and stir to mix.
                It needs to be stonking hot. When you see smoke started to rise. Add cooking oil or lard.Add garlic and quickly stir fry for about 10 seconds or the garlic might get burn. Add slices of Chinese sausage, fish cake, and shrimp, stir fry until the shrimp just turn pink and not fully cooked yet. Push them to the side of the wok.
                In the video, I actually cracked in eggs here before adding the noodles. You can do that too. Either way is fine. In this step-by-step instruction I add rice noodles followed by seasonings. Continue to stir fry to make sure sauce is coating the noodles and the noodles get some “charred” on some spots, about 1 minute. Crack in two eggs and let them cook undisturbed for about 20 seconds. If you use blood cockles, add them here in this step. Then break the yolk and mix it with the noodles and everything else in the wok. Quickly have a taste and add more soy sauce if needed. Turn off the heat and add beansprouts and garlic chives. Stir to mix everything. The residual heat will continue to soften the chives and the beansprouts are still crunchy but do not taste raw. Dish out from the wok and portion it out onto a plate lined with banana leaves (optional) and top with some fried lard pieces if you want. Serve immediately.

            <h3><u>Instructions:</u></h3>
            <p>Slice ginger lengthwise into thin, large pieces. Cut chicken into large chunks. Pour enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of your pan. You can use any kind of pan with high sides: a saute pan, Dutch oven, stockpot, etc. Turn the heat to medium-high and add ginger slices to the pan, stirring and cooking for 1-2 minutes. It should already smell fragrant in your kitchen!Add chicken pieces and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add wine, soy sauce, sugar, water and any extra ingredients you desire. I like to add dried shiitake mushrooms that have been soaked, and I use the water they were soaking in for even more umami flavor. Stir until the liquid is bubbling slightly. Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally so all parts of the chicken get coated with the sauce.
